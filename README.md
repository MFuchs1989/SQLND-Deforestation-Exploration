## Introduction

As a data analyst, I have been assigned the task of producing a meaningful report on deforestation worldwide for ForestQuery, a non-profit organization whose mission is to reduce deforestation around the world and raise awareness about this important environmental issue. 

Its management aims to find out in which countries and regions around the world forests appear to be shrinking and in which countries and regions forest cover is greatest, both in terms of quantity and percentage of total land area.

## Data Provided

Three tables were provided that included information on afforestation as well as total area and regional groupings.

+ forest_area.csv
+ land_area.csv
+ regions.csv

## Project Results

The report includes five sections:

+ Global Situation
+ Regional Outlook
+ Country-Level Detail
+ Recommendations
+ Appendix: SQL queries used

## Project Motivation: 

Udacity has given students the freedom to choose the area in which they would like to complete their capstone project. Possible technical fields would have been:

+ [Robot Motion Planning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZFCH6jS3A5At7_v5IUM5OpAXJYiutFuSIjTzV_E-vdE/pub)
+ [Healthcare](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WzurKKa9AX2DnOH7KiB38mvozdOSemfkGpex8hdTy8c/pub)
+ [Computer Vision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y-XfjkPFgUQxFIQ9bBncUSjs4HOf5E-45FrLYNBsZb4/pub)
+ [Education](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vjerjRQnWs1kLbZagDYT6rNqiwAG23Yj45oUY88IAxI/pub)
+ [Investment and Trading](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ycGeb1QYKATG6jvz74SAMqxrlek9Ed4RYrzWNhWS-0Q/pub)

As I am personally very interested in Deep Learning and have already completed my Nanodegree in Computer Vision via Udacity, I found it exciting to complete my capstone project in this area as well. 
So I choose to use Convolutional Neural Networks to Identify Dog Breeds.
